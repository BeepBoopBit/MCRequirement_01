# Simple JS Program


## Description

This program is a simple project that consists of applying variable creation, functions, loops, and function calling.
It aims to see how you apply the fundamentals of programming.

## Getting Started

### Executing program

To run this program, all you need to have is node.js. You can download it using this [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager)

Once you've downloaded node, you can then run it using your terminal by typing "node <path-to-your-program>"

### Changing the Code

If you want to change the code to add your own NFTs for displaying, you can use the following template:

```js
mintNFT({name: <insert-name>, description: <insert-description>});
```

After you've created your new NFT, you can just add it before the `listNFTs()` function call.

Run and test your program
